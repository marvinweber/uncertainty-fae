# Uncertainty Quantification in Forensic Age Estimation

(!) WIP

## Directory Structure
- `config`: (Example) config files.
- `notebooks`: Notebooks with examples and or smaller evaluations, etc.
- `slurm_commands`: Scripts and Description for Slurm Job Usage (for training and
  evaluation) for the FAE framework.
- `scripts`: Python scripts for training, evaluation, etc.
- `src/rsna_boneage`: Code for the RSNA Bon Age dataset.
- `src/swa_gaussian`: Base code for SWAG (see `swa_gaussian/README.md` for
  details).
- `src/uncertainty_fae`: Code for the generic uncertainty part (e.g.,
  interfaces, evaulation code, and so on...).
- `src/uncertainty_fae/util`: Utility methods and classes (mainly used by or
  helful for usage with the uncertainty framework).

## Notebook Usage
If you want to write and/or use the notebooks, you should install the
`ipykernel` and `ipywidgets` packages.
